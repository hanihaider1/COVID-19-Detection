# COVID-19-Detection
As COVID-19 has caused a lot of deaths in the past year, some of the symptoms of 
COVID-19 are the same as that of bacterial pneumonia: pulmonary infection that 
inflammation and fluid in lungs. Since it looks very similar to bacterial pneum
difficult to differentiate between them. Our model will help doctors provide a 
reliable diagnosis to tell if the person has the virus or not. This will help 
treatment before the virus takes hold.

For each test image, we are predicting a bounding box (which shows if COVID-19 
or not) and a class of all the findings. If there is no finding, the class woul
there is any deduction, it should make the following determination: ‘Negative’,
‘Indeterminate’, ‘Atypical.’ The result will be stored in a boolean representat
and 0 for False.This project seems interesting to us because COVID-19 has taken
lives in the past couple of years and it still is.
